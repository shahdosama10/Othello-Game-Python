___Just a reminder___<br> 
we will use GitHub so I want to remind us of the basic process with get while we work on the project:
  1. firstly clone the project on your PC using `git clone github-URL`
  2. before writing any code, you need to create a branch using `git checkout -b branch-name`
  3. after coding in the project and uploading the work start with `git add file-name`
  4. then commit your files with what you doing in it with `git commit -m "your-commit-here"`
  5. then push your code on github with `git push origin branch-name`
  6. then go to github.com, to the project repository make a pull request for your job, and merge your job
  7. then go locally on your PC after merging the code and change the branch to the main one using `git checkout main`
  8. and pull the final version of the code using `git pull origin main`
  9. (_Optional and preferred step_) after that go and delete the branch that you used before using `git branch -d branch-name`
